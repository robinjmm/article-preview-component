## About
This is my solution for the challenge of building an article preview component from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

This is the second challenge where I'm using JavaScript, and thankfully nothing too complicated is involved yet. 

The layout and style of the card is rather simple to re-create. However, I struggled a lot when implementing the tool-tip and its different designs on small and large screen sizes. I managed to complete the challenge and even add some animations, but its not perfect.

Hopefully, I can come back and improve my solution in the future.

**Any feedback on how to improve my solution would be greatly appreciated.** ðŸ˜Š
